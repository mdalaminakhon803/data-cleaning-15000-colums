# Large-Scale Data Cleaning Project (14,833+ Columns)
## 1. Project Summary
This project focuses on cleaning and standardizing a very large dataset containing over 14,833 columns.
The objective was to make the dataset analysis-ready by improving structure, consistency, and reliability.
#
This repository documents the **entire data cleaning workflow**, including assumptions, decisions, and outputs.
## 2. Dataset Overview
- Total Columns: 14,833+
- Rows: High-volume (confidential)
- Data Types:
  - Numeric
  - Categorical
  - Text
  - Mixed formats
### Key Data Quality Issues Identified
- Missing values across multiple columns
- Duplicate and near-duplicate columns
- Inconsistent column naming conventions
- Incorrect data types
- High sparsity in certain feature groups
-

## 4. Cleaning Strategy
The cleaning process was designed to be **scalable and reproducible**.
### Steps Performed
1. Column name normalization
2. Removal of duplicate columns
3. Missing value analysis and treatment
4. Data type correction
5. Validation checks
6. Export of cleaned dataset
## 5. Tools & Technologies
- Microsoft Exel
- Ai
- Flash Fill
## 6. Output
- Cleaned dataset stored in `data/cleaned/`
- Reusable Python script for future datasets
- Documented notebook with explanations
## 7. Notes on Data Availability
Due to GitHub file size limitations and data confidentiality,
only a representative sample of the dataset is uploaded.
